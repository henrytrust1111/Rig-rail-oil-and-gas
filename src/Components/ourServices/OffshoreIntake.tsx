              In line with our pioneering mentality and our innovative approach
              to business, we have identified the huge inefficiencies in the
              Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, and have taken adequate steps to
              bridge these gaps, by the development of one of Africaâ€™s largest
              offshore Petroleum intake/offtake and storage terminals to provide
              compelling Logistic advantages to the entire oil and gas value
              chain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The facility comprises a world class Single Point Mooring (SPM)
              and Conventional Buoy Mooring (CBM). These facilities can receive
              up to 150,000 DWT vessels, with the ability to discharge up to
              100,000 MT of petroleum products within 48hours. The facilities
              have full terminal automation and radar gauging systems, built
              with the highest safety standards.
            </p>
            <p>
              To facilitate efficient load out of products, we have extensive
              truck gantries with sufficient loading arms to fill and dispatch
              up to 600 trucks daily. In addition, the facility will give
              operators access to purpose-built truck parking in the Freezone,
              reduced time for truck loading and direct access to artery roads
              leading to the East and North.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Facility is located within the Lekki Free Trade Zone, giving
              operators and users the advantage of numerous fiscal and economic
              incentives.
